# RHEL-07-020270
# If vsftpd is required, remove 'ftp' from rhel7stig_unnecessary_accounts.
#
# By default, files owned by removed users will be retained, but this may
# trigger RHEL-07-020320 (all files and directories must have a valid owner).
# Set rhel7stig_remove_unnecessary_user_files to yes to remove old files,
# but this could remove files you intended to keep. And it's probably best to
# avoid removing 'dbus', 'nobody', 'systemd-network', and 'polkitd', as they all
# have home directories of '/' by default.
