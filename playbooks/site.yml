# site.yml is the overall playbook, but all it does is include the other playbooks that are part of the site. For more
# information about the structure see:
# http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_best_practices.html
# http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_inventory.html
# We follow the guidance to include naming conventions there.
