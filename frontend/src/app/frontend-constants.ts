export const EXPLANATION: string = " Kubernetes will \
not cap the performance of the resource at the specified number of cores - it will \
guarentee that amount of compute resource is available if the application needs it. For example, \
if Bro were set to 60%, it is guarenteed to have at least 60% of the server available \
to it. However, if it were only using 30% and something else needed 60%, the other \
thing would be allowed to infringe on Bro's guarenteed resources. If Bro's needs suddenly grew and it \
required the compute resources given out to the other thing, Kubernetes would \
throttle the other thing and Bro would be allowed to burst up to 60% while the other thing \
would be throttled to whatever its resource request is. Basically, this allows everything \
to take whatever it needs at any given time if the sensor is not resource constrained. \
If the sensor becomes resource constrained, each thing will be limited to what it \
requested. See resource requests: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/ and https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/."

export const WHAT_IS_CEPH = {"label": "What is Ceph?", "description": "Ceph is what is called a \
  clustered storage solution. Ceph allows \
  us to take a hard drive on an individual machine and add it to a Ceph cluster. \
  Instead of that hard drive only being attached to the machine on which it physically \
  resides, it is effectively added to a singular \"mega hard drive\" which is spread \
  across multiple devices. Kubernetes can then create what are called persistent \
  volumes from the space allocated from this hard drive. A persistent volume acts \
  like a hard drive attached to a single Docker Container. For example, you might have \
  a persistent volume of 8 GB attached to an Elasticsearch instance. If that instance \
  of Elasticsearch dies for whatever reason, Kubernetes creates another identical \
  instance and reattaches the persistent volume containing the Elasticsearch data. \
  In this way, containers can die, migrate, or be manipulated without loss of data."}


export const HELP_ME_DECIDE = {"label": "Help me decide", "description": "If you plan to have a high volume \
  of input traffic to the kit, typically more than 1 Gb/s, it's typically better to go with \"Use hard drive for PCAP storage\"\
  storage, but that assumes a 1Gb/s network backbone. If you have a faster backbone, than it's really \
  a bit of a judgement call. The bottleneck is typically the network backbone. When \
  you have all that PCAP coming in, parts must traverse the network if you are using \
  clustered storage. This can frequently overwhelm a 1Gb/s pipe. If you are on a slower \
  network, it's better to use Ceph because you get all the benefits of a clustered \
  storage solution. If you don't know, it's better to stick with \"Use hard drive for PCAP storage\""};
